# GradCAM_sPCa_Classification

## Overview
This project is about establishing the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) on a ResNet-18 or ResNet-34 model for significant vs non-significant prostate cancer classification task. There is only one file named `GradCAM_ResNet18_ISUPClassification_partialdata_binary_2d_nodp_nobn.ipynb"

## Features
- Implementation of Grad-CAM for detailed visual insights into model predictions.
- Custom adaptation of ResNet18 tailored for medical image processing.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9
- monai 0.9.0
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

## Usage
Execute the Jupyter notebook to apply the model:
